This folder contains the logic trees necessary to accurately re-create each social class schema included in this app. 

For many schemas used, existing documentation already exists. Wright's full schema is provided here because to our knowledge, there is no logic tree that exists for that schema. Additionally, the Simplified Wright Schema is one that has been specially created for this app, as such no logic tree exists for it. The GBCS logic tree was provided to us by the team that created the original BBC GBCS application and our thanks go out to them for providing it for our use. The logic behind the GBCS 2013 paper is provided and outlined in several papers most notably Savage et al (2013).
