There are two .app files within this subfolder. The first, named 'Class Calculator Full' refers to the 'full' application. This means that this app contains every single social class schema that the team has created with all extensions applied. On a free version of Shinyapps.io, this can run into some memory issues especially when teaching large pools of students. For this reason a 'light' version has also been created that strips back to the basics of each class schema. This removes the latent trait analysis of the full Great British Class Survey but importantly keeps the BBC version. It also cuts the 'full' traditional Wright social class schema and keeps the simplified version. This was done less out of memory concerns and more for a time concern for any teachers - the full schema takes a long time to effectively complete. We suggest if you plan to use this for large-scale teaching to use the light version and edit it accordingly to your own needs.

Other than the two seperate app folders, if the full version is planned for use do remember you will need the relevant .dta files of the Great British Class Survey which can be downloaded from the UK Data Service.
